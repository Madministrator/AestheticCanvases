# Canvas Playground
This is just a simple project to pass some free time. The primary goal is to just write some JavaScript that interacts with an HTML5 canvas element to draw some really neat things.

In addition, I want all of these programs to be easy to use, so that all you need to do is call a single function and pass the HTML5 canvas element to them to start filling the canvas with some aesthetically pleasing appearance that could be added to any webpage.

At this point, it's all just ideas that I am brainstorming before I actually start coding. If you're interested in trying this yourself, there [are some good resources on the internet](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp) that you can read up on how canvas elements work and how to use them. There are [plenty of tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) out there if you look around for a little bit.

I realize I'm not the first to do most of these, [here is an example of a similar concept done for linux](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/screenshots/), and [here is another kind of project done with canvas elements](https://kunalverma94.github.io/gallery/gallery.html). This project is more for fun than as an academic research project or anything meant to be taken seriously.

## Idea List
These are very rough ideas, not meant to go into real detail.
- clustered / "blobbed" connected graphs
- shifting gradient background
- sine / cosine wave generated patterns
- glowing particles
- fireflies
- spiral graphs
- fractal geometery generator
- a little something that chases around your mouse.
- fireworks that fly in from the bottom of the screen and explode where you clicked.
- application of 'boids' algorithm to generate swarm behavior to start making something interesting.
